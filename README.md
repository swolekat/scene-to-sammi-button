# scene-to-sammi-button
Small application to be able to make the json to a sammi button from a given obs scene.

## Limitations
* doesn't support nested scenes
* assumes your wanting to make a button for the Main obs

If you are running a portable OBS you need to either drag and drop your scene json files into the app or have OBS running.


## How to install

Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/swolekat/scene-to-sammi-button/releases) and find the latest release. Download the .exe file and run it. The app will be installed.

## Usage
Select your scene collection. Then click on your desires scene. Then in sammi go to a deck and right click on an empty space. Select "Import from JSON". Enjoy your button :3
